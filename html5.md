    if (navigator.geolocation) {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
            var latitude = position.coords.latitude;
            var longitude = position.coords.longitude;
            console.log("Latitude: " + latitude + ", Longitude: " + longitude);
        });
    } else {
        console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
    }
    ```



11. **Explain the difference between local storage and session storage in HTML5.**
   - **Local Storage:** Local storage in HTML5 allows data to be stored locally in the browser with no expiration date. The data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened, and it is accessible across browser sessions and tabs for the same origin.
   - **Session Storage:** Session storage is similar to local storage but has a session scope. Data stored in session storage is only accessible during the lifetime of the page session. Once the browser tab or window is closed, the data is cleared and not accessible anymore.

12. **What are Web Workers in HTML5, and how do they work?**
    - Web Workers in HTML5 are JavaScript files that run in the background, separate from the main browser thread. They allow for concurrent execution of scripts to improve performance and responsiveness. Web Workers work by running scripts in a separate thread, enabling long-running tasks to execute without blocking the UI thread.

13. **How do you implement drag and drop functionality in HTML5?**
    - Drag and drop functionality in HTML5 can be implemented using the Drag and Drop API. You need to handle events such as `dragstart`, `dragover`, `drop`, and `dragend`. These events allow you to define the behavior of draggable elements and drop targets. Here's a basic example:
    ```html
    <div id="draggable" draggable="true">Drag me!</div>
    <div id="droppable">Drop here!</div>

    <script>
        var draggable = document.getElementById("draggable");
        var droppable = document.getElementById("droppable");

        draggable.addEventListener("dragstart", function(event) {
            event.dataTransfer.setData("text/plain", event.target.id);
        });

        droppable.addEventListener("dragover", function(event) {
            event.preventDefault();
        });

        droppable.addEventListener("drop", function(event) {
            event.preventDefault();
            var data = event.dataTransfer.getData("text/plain");
            var draggedElement = document.getElementById(data);
            droppable.appendChild(draggedElement);
        });
    </script>
    ```

    ```javascript
    var socket = new WebSocket("ws://example.com/socket");
    
    socket.onopen = function(event) {
        console.log("WebSocket connection established.");
    };
    
    socket.onmessage = function(event) {
        console.log("Message received: " + event.data);
    };
    
    socket.onerror = function(event) {
        console.error("WebSocket error: " + event);
    };
    
    socket.onclose = function(event) {
        console.log("WebSocket connection closed.");
    };
    ```

22. **What is the purpose of the `<datalist>` element in HTML5?**
