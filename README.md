# [TypeScript Interview Questions](https://dev.to/rajrathod/series/23839)


### TypeScript Basics:

1. **What is TypeScript and how does it differ from JavaScript?**
   - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft. It adds optional static typing, classes, interfaces, and other features to JavaScript. The main difference is that TypeScript introduces static types, which provide type-checking at compile-time, whereas JavaScript is dynamically typed and performs type-checking at runtime.

2. **What are the key features of TypeScript?**
   - TypeScript's key features include static typing, interfaces, classes, modules, generics, enums, decorators, and a rich type system that provides better tooling, code organization, and scalability compared to plain JavaScript.

3. **How do you install TypeScript?**
   - You can install TypeScript globally using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command:
     ```
     npm install -g typescript
     ```
     Alternatively, you can install it locally in your project by omitting the `-g` flag.

4. **Explain the benefits of using TypeScript.**
   - TypeScript offers several benefits, including:
     - Enhanced code quality and maintainability through static typing.
     - Early error detection during development.
     - Improved code organization and scalability through features like interfaces, classes, and modules.
     - Better tooling support with features like code navigation, auto-completion, and refactoring tools.
     - Increased productivity and reduced debugging time.
     - Seamless integration with existing JavaScript codebases.

5. **What are the different data types in TypeScript?**
   - TypeScript supports various data types, including:
     - **Boolean:** Represents true or false values.
     - **Number:** Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
     - **String:** Represents textual data.
     - **Array:** Represents a collection of elements of the same type.
     - **Tuple:** Represents an array with a fixed number of elements of different types.
     - **Enum:** Represents a set of named constants.
     - **Any:** Represents a dynamic or unknown type.
     - **Void:** Represents the absence of a type.
     - **Null** and **Undefined:** Represent null and undefined values, respectively.
     - **Never:** Represents a type that never occurs.

6. **Explain the difference between `null` and `undefined` in TypeScript.**
   - `null` and `undefined` are both used to represent absence of value in TypeScript, but they are subtly different:
     - **`null`:** Represents an intentional absence of any value or an empty value. It is typically assigned to variables by developers.
     - **`undefined`:** Represents an uninitialized value or a value that hasn't been assigned yet. It is often used by the runtime environment to denote an absence of value.

7. **How do you declare variables in TypeScript?**
   - Variables in TypeScript can be declared using the `let`, `const`, or `var` keywords, similar to JavaScript. For example:
     ```typescript
     let myVar: number = 10;
     const myConst: string = "Hello";
     var myVar2: boolean = true;
     ```
     You can also declare variables without explicitly specifying their types, in which case TypeScript infers the types based on the assigned values. For example:
     ```typescript
     let myVar = 10; // TypeScript infers myVar as number
     const myConst = "Hello"; // TypeScript infers myConst as string
     var myVar2 = true; // TypeScript infers myVar2 as boolean
     ```

### TypeScript Types and Interfaces:

8. **What are TypeScript interfaces?**
   - Interfaces in TypeScript are used to define the structure of objects. They specify the properties and methods that an object must have to be considered an instance of a particular type. Interfaces are purely a compile-time construct and do not have any impact on the generated JavaScript code.

9. **How do interfaces differ from classes in TypeScript?**
   - Interfaces define the structure of objects and are purely abstract, meaning they cannot contain any implementation details. They only define the shape of an object. Classes, on the other hand, can contain both property and method definitions as well as implementation details. Classes are used to create instances (objects) that can be instantiated and used at runtime.

10. **Explain type assertion in TypeScript.**
    - Type assertion in TypeScript is a way to tell the compiler about the type of a variable when the compiler is unable to infer the type automatically. It allows you to override the default behavior of the type checker. Type assertion can be done using two syntaxes: angle-bracket syntax (`

```typescript
let someValue: any = "hello";
let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;
```

11. **What are union types and intersection types in TypeScript?**
    - **Union types:** Union types allow a variable to hold values of multiple types. You can specify a union type using the `|` operator. For example:
      ```typescript
      let myVar: number | string;
      ```
    - **Intersection types:** Intersection types allow you to combine multiple types into one. They are specified using the `&` operator. For example:
      ```typescript
      interface A {
          foo: number;
      }
      
      interface B {
          bar: string;
      }
      
      let myVar: A & B;
      ```

12. **How do you define optional properties in interfaces?**
    - To define optional properties in interfaces, you can use the `?` modifier after the property name. Optional properties may or may not be present in the object that implements the interface. For example:
      ```typescript
      interface Person {
          name: string;
          age?: number; // Optional property
      }
      ```

13. **Can you extend interfaces in TypeScript?**
    - Yes, interfaces can extend other interfaces in TypeScript. This allows you to create new interfaces that inherit properties and methods from existing interfaces. The syntax for extending an interface is similar to extending a class. For example:
      ```typescript
      interface Shape {
          color: string;
      }
      
      interface Square extends Shape {
          sideLength: number;
      }
      ```

14. **What is an index signature in TypeScript?**
    - An index signature in TypeScript allows you to define the types for properties that are not known at compile time but can be accessed using an index, typically a string or a number. This is useful when working with objects that have dynamic keys. The syntax for an index signature is `[key: type]: valueType`. For example:
      ```typescript
      interface Dictionary {
          [key: string]: number;
      }
      ```
      This defines an interface where the keys are strings, and the values are numbers.

### TypeScript Functions:


15. **What is the syntax for declaring functions in TypeScript?**
    - TypeScript supports two syntaxes for declaring functions:
      - Function Declaration:
        ```typescript
        function add(x: number, y: number): number {
            return x + y;
        }
        ```
      - Function Expression:
        ```typescript
        const add = function(x: number, y: number): number {
            return x + y;
        };
        ```

16. **Explain arrow functions in TypeScript.**
    - Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions. They are defined using the `=>` syntax. Arrow functions automatically bind the `this` context of the enclosing scope. For example:
      ```typescript
      const add = (x: number, y: number): number => {
          return x + y;
      };
      ```

17. **How do you define optional parameters in TypeScript functions?**
    - Optional parameters in TypeScript functions are denoted by appending a `?` to the parameter name in the function declaration. Optional parameters can be omitted when calling the function, and their value will be `undefined`. For example:
      ```typescript
      function greet(name?: string): void {
          console.log(`Hello, ${name || "World"}!`);
      }
      ```

18. **What is function overloading in TypeScript?**
    - Function overloading in TypeScript allows you to define multiple function signatures for the same function name. This enables you to create functions that can accept different combinations of parameters or return different types based on the input. TypeScript uses these function signatures to perform type checking and inference. For example:
      ```typescript
      function add(x: number, y: number): number;
      function add(x: string, y: string): string;
      
      function add(x: any, y: any): any {
          return x + y;
      }
      ```

19. **Explain the concept of "this" in TypeScript functions.**
    - In TypeScript, `this` refers to the current execution context within a function. It can change depending on how a function is called. Arrow functions capture the `this` value from the surrounding lexical context, while regular functions have their `this` value determined by how they are invoked (e.g., using `call`, `apply`, or as a method of an object).

20. **How do you define default parameter values in TypeScript functions?**
    - Default parameter values in TypeScript functions can be specified by assigning a default value to a parameter in the function declaration. If a value is not provided for that parameter during the function call, the default value will be used. For example:
      ```typescript
      function greet(name: string = "World"): void {
          console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
      }
      ```

21. **What are the differences between `function` and `() =>` syntax in TypeScript?**
    - The main differences between `function` and `() =>` syntax in TypeScript are:
      - Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context; they inherit `this` from the surrounding lexical context. Regular functions have their `this` context determined by how they are invoked.
      - Arrow functions have a more concise syntax, especially for one-liners.
      - Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors and do not have their own `arguments` object. Regular functions do have their own `arguments` object and can be used as constructors with `new`.


### TypeScript Classes:

22. **How do you define classes in TypeScript?**
    - Classes in TypeScript are defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name. Inside the class body, you can define properties and methods. Here's an example:
      ```typescript
      class Person {
          name: string;
          age: number;
          
          constructor(name: string, age: number) {
              this.name = name;
              this.age = age;
          }
          
          greet(): void {
              console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
          }
      }
      ```

23. **Explain the concepts of inheritance and encapsulation in TypeScript.**
    - **Inheritance:** In TypeScript, inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass). Subclasses can extend the functionality of their superclass and also override inherited methods. This promotes code reuse and hierarchical organization of code.
    - **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). In TypeScript, encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers like `public`, `private`, and `protected`, which control the visibility and accessibility of class members.

24. **What are access modifiers in TypeScript classes?**
    - Access modifiers in TypeScript classes control the visibility and accessibility of class members (properties and methods). TypeScript supports three access modifiers:
      - **Public (`public`):** Members marked as `public` are accessible from outside the class.
      - **Private (`private`):** Members marked as `private` are only accessible within the class that defines them. They cannot be accessed from outside the class.
      - **Protected (`protected`):** Members marked as `protected` are accessible within the class that defines them and within subclasses.

25. **How do you implement interfaces in classes?**
    - Interfaces can be implemented in classes by using the `implements` keyword followed by the interface name. The class must provide implementations for all the members defined in the interface. Here's an example:
      ```typescript
      interface Printable {
          print(): void;
      }
      
      class Document implements Printable {
          print(): void {
              console.log("Printing document...");
          }
      }
      ```

26. **Explain the difference between abstract classes and interfaces in TypeScript.**
    - **Abstract classes:** Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated directly. They can contain abstract methods (methods without a body) that must be implemented by subclasses. Abstract classes can also contain concrete methods and properties. They provide a way to define a common interface for a group of related classes.
    - **Interfaces:** Interfaces are purely a structural contract that enforces the shape of an object. They cannot contain any implementation details. Classes can implement multiple interfaces, but they cannot extend multiple classes. Interfaces are primarily used for defining contracts between different parts of your code.

27. **What is a static property in TypeScript?**
    - Static properties in TypeScript belong to the class itself rather than to instances of the class. They are accessed using the class name rather than through an instance of the class. Static properties are declared using the `static` keyword. For example:
      ```typescript
      class Circle {
          static PI: number = 3.14;
          radius: number;
          
          constructor(radius: number) {
              this.radius = radius;
          }
          
          getArea(): number {
              return Circle.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
          }
      }
      ```

28. **How do you achieve method overriding in TypeScript classes?**
    - Method overriding in TypeScript is achieved by declaring a method with the same signature in a subclass as the one in its superclass. The subclass method overrides the behavior of the superclass method. To call the superclass method from within the subclass method, you can use the `super` keyword. Here's an example:
      ```typescript
      class Animal {
          makeSound(): void {
              console.log("Animal makes a sound");
          }
      }
      
      class Dog extends Animal {
          makeSound(): void {
              console.log("Dog barks");
          }
          
          makeSuperSound(): void {
              super.makeSound(); // Calling superclass method
          }
      }
      ```

### TypeScript Modules:

29. **What are modules in TypeScript?**
    - Modules in TypeScript are a way to organize code into reusable units. They allow you to encapsulate related functionality and expose only what is necessary for other parts of your program. Modules can contain classes, functions, variables, and other TypeScript entities. TypeScript supports both CommonJS and ES6 module formats.

30. **Explain the difference between CommonJS and ES6 modules.**
    - **CommonJS:** CommonJS is a module system used primarily in Node.js environments. It uses `require()` to import modules and `module.exports` or `exports` to export them. CommonJS modules are synchronous and loaded on-demand.
    - **ES6 modules:** ES6 modules are the standardized module system in JavaScript. They use `import` and `export` statements for importing and exporting modules, respectively. ES6 modules are asynchronous and statically analyzable, which allows for better optimization.

31. **How do you export and import modules in TypeScript?**
    - **Exporting:**
      - Named exports:
        ```typescript
        // Exporting individual entities
        export const myVar: number = 10;
        export function myFunc(): void { /* Function definition */ }
        
        // Exporting a class
        export class MyClass { /* Class definition */ }
        ```
      - Default export:
        ```typescript
        // Exporting a default entity
        export default class MyClass { /* Class definition */ }
        ```
    - **Importing:**
      - Named imports:
        ```typescript
        import { myVar, myFunc } from "./myModule";
        ```
      - Default import:
        ```typescript
        import MyClass from "./myModule";
        ```

32. **What is the difference between `export default` and named exports in TypeScript?**
    - **Named exports:** With named exports, you can export multiple entities from a module by specifying their names explicitly. Named exports are imported using the corresponding names.
    - **Export default:** With export default, you can export a single entity as the default export from a module. There can only be one default export per module. Default exports are imported using any name of the developer's choice.
    - Example:
      ```typescript
      // Named exports
      export const myVar: number = 10;
      export function myFunc(): void { /* Function definition */ }

      // Default export
      export default class MyClass { /* Class definition */ }
      ```
      ```typescript
      // Importing named exports
      import { myVar, myFunc } from "./myModule";

      // Importing default export
      import MyClass from "./myModule";
      ```

### TypeScript Generics:

33. **What are generics in TypeScript?**
    - Generics in TypeScript allow you to create reusable components that can work with a variety of data types while maintaining type safety. They enable you to write flexible and type-safe code by parameterizing types and functions.

34. **Explain the use of generics in functions.**
    - Generics in functions allow you to create functions that can operate on a variety of data types without losing type safety. You can specify generic type parameters within angle brackets (`

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
}

// Call the generic function with a number argument
let result1 = identity<number>(10); // result1 is of type number

// Call the generic function with a string argument
let result2 = identity<string>("Hello"); // result2 is of type string
```

35. **How do you create generic classes in TypeScript?**
    - You can create generic classes in TypeScript by adding type parameters to the class declaration. These type parameters can then be used throughout the class definition. Here's an example:
    ```typescript
    class Box<T> {
        private value: T;
        
        constructor(value: T) {
            this.value = value;
        }
        
        getValue(): T {
            return this.value;
        }
    }
    
    // Create a Box instance with number type
    let box1 = new Box<number>(10);
    console.log(box1.getValue()); // Output: 10
    
    // Create a Box instance with string type
    let box2 = new Box<string>("Hello");
    console.log(box2.getValue()); // Output: Hello
    ```

36. **What are generic constraints in TypeScript?**
    - Generic constraints in TypeScript allow you to restrict the types that can be used as type arguments for a generic type parameter. You can specify constraints using the `extends` keyword followed by a type or an interface. This ensures that the type parameter satisfies certain conditions. For example:
    ```typescript
    interface Printable {
        print(): void;
    }
    
    function printValue<T extends Printable>(obj: T): void {
        obj.print();
    }
    ```
    In this example, the `printValue` function accepts only objects that implement the `Printable` interface.

37. **Provide an example of a generic function with constraints.**
    ```typescript
    interface Lengthwise {
        length: number;
    }
    
    function getLength<T extends Lengthwise>(arg: T): number {
        return arg.length;
    }
    
    let len1 = getLength("Hello"); // len1 is of type number
    console.log(len1); // Output: 5
    
    let len2 = getLength([1, 2, 3]); // len2 is of type number
    console.log(len2); // Output: 3
    
    // This will cause a compilation error because 42 does not have a 'length' property
    // let len3 = getLength(42);
    ```

### Advanced TypeScript:


38. **What are decorators in TypeScript?**
    - Decorators are a TypeScript feature used to add metadata or behavior to classes, methods, properties, or parameters at design time. They are denoted by an `@` symbol followed by the decorator function's name. Decorators can be used for various purposes such as logging, validation, dependency injection, and more.

39. **How do you use decorators to create custom metadata in TypeScript?**
    - Decorators can be used to create custom metadata by attaching metadata information to classes, methods, properties, or parameters. You can define custom decorator functions that accept metadata arguments and apply them to the target element. Here's an example:
    ```typescript
    function MyDecorator(target: any) {
        target.customMetadata = "Hello, this is custom metadata!";
    }

    @MyDecorator
    class MyClass {
        // Class definition
    }

    console.log(MyClass.customMetadata); // Output: Hello, this is custom metadata!
    ```

40. **Explain the concept of Mixins in TypeScript.**
    - Mixins in TypeScript allow you to combine multiple classes into a single class. They enable you to reuse and compose functionalities from multiple sources. Mixins are achieved by applying a combination of inheritance and interfaces. They are particularly useful when you want to add features to a class without creating a deep class hierarchy.

41. **What is the keyof operator in TypeScript?**
    - The `keyof` operator in TypeScript is a type operator that produces a union type of all property names of a given type. It allows you to create types that represent the keys of an object without specifying them explicitly. The syntax is `keyof Type`. Here's an example:
    ```typescript
    interface Person {
        name: string;
        age: number;
        address: string;
    }

    type PersonKeys = keyof Person; // PersonKeys is "name" | "age" | "address"
    ```

42. **How do you create mapped types in TypeScript?**
    - Mapped types in TypeScript allow you to create new types by transforming each property in an existing type. You can use mapped types to modify the properties' types, add or remove properties, or make properties optional or read-only. Mapped types are defined using the `Record<K, T>` utility type or by using the `in` keyword. Here's an example:
    ```typescript
    interface Person {
        name: string;
        age: number;
    }

    type ReadonlyPerson = {
        readonly [K in keyof Person]: Person[K];
    };

    const person: ReadonlyPerson = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
    ```

43. **What are conditional types in TypeScript?**
    - Conditional types in TypeScript allow you to create types that depend on other types. They enable you to express complex type transformations based on conditionals. Conditional types are defined using the `extends` keyword and the ternary conditional operator `? :`. They are particularly useful for creating generic types that adapt based on the types they are applied to. Here's an example:
    ```typescript
    type NonNullable<T> = T extends null | undefined ? never : T;

    type NonNullableString = NonNullable<string | null>; // NonNullableString is string
    ```

### Error Handling in TypeScript:

44. **How do you handle errors in TypeScript?**
    - In TypeScript, you can handle errors using the `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks. The `try` block contains the code that may throw an error. If an error occurs within the `try` block, it is caught by the `catch` block where you can handle or log the error. The `finally` block is optional and is executed regardless of whether an error occurs or not. Here's an example:
    ```typescript
    try {
        // Code that may throw an error
        throw new Error("Something went wrong");
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle or log the error
        console.error("Error:", error.message);
    } finally {
        // Clean up code
        console.log("Finally block executed");
    }
    ```

45. **What is the purpose of try-catch blocks in TypeScript?**
    - The purpose of try-catch blocks in TypeScript is to handle exceptions or errors that occur during the execution of code within the try block. By wrapping potentially error-prone code in a try block, you can catch and handle any exceptions that occur, preventing them from crashing the entire program. This allows for graceful error handling and recovery.

46. **Explain the difference between throw and throw new Error() in TypeScript.**
    - In TypeScript, both `throw` and `throw new Error()` are used to throw exceptions, but they differ in what they throw:
      - **`throw`:** The `throw` statement can be used to throw any value as an exception. It can throw any object, string, number, or boolean. For example:
        ```typescript
        throw "An error occurred"; // Throws a string
        ```
      - **`throw new Error()`:** The `throw new Error()` statement is used to throw an instance of the `Error` class. It allows you to provide a meaningful error message along with the thrown error. This is typically the preferred way to throw errors in TypeScript. For example:
        ```typescript
        throw new Error("An error occurred"); // Throws an Error object with the specified message
        ```


### Promises and Async/Await in TypeScript:

47. **What are promises in TypeScript?**
    - Promises in TypeScript are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They allow you to handle asynchronous operations more easily by providing a cleaner and more readable syntax compared to using callbacks directly. Promises can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

48. **Explain the difference between callbacks and promises.**
    - **Callbacks:** Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to another function and are executed asynchronously once the operation completes. Callbacks can lead to callback hell or pyramid of doom, making the code difficult to read and maintain.
    - **Promises:** Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations. They represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and allow you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together using `.then()` and `.catch()` methods. Promises help avoid callback hell and make asynchronous code more readable and maintainable.

49. **How do you handle multiple promises in TypeScript?**
    - You can handle multiple promises in TypeScript using Promise.all(), Promise.race(), or async/await syntax.
      - **Promise.all():** Waits for all promises to be resolved or for any to be rejected.
      ```typescript
      const promise1 = Promise.resolve(1);
      const promise2 = Promise.resolve(2);
      const promise3 = Promise.resolve(3);
      
      Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
          .then(values => console.log(values)) // Output: [1, 2, 3]
          .catch(error => console.error(error));
      ```
      - **Promise.race():** Waits for the first promise to be resolved or rejected.
      ```typescript
      const promise1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000, 'one'));
      const promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000, 'two'));
      
      Promise.race([promise1, promise2])
          .then(value => console.log(value)) // Output: one
          .catch(error => console.error(error));
      ```
      - **Async/Await:** You can use async/await to handle multiple promises sequentially or concurrently.
      ```typescript
      async function example() {
          const result1 = await promise1();
          const result2 = await promise2();
          // Handle results
      }
      ```

50. **What are async functions in TypeScript?**
    - Async functions in TypeScript are functions that enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior. They allow you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous, making it easier to read and understand. Async functions always return a promise, which resolves with the function's return value or rejects with an error thrown within the function.

51. **How do you use the async/await syntax in TypeScript?**
    - Async/await syntax in TypeScript allows you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous. The `async` keyword is used to define an asynchronous function, and the `await` keyword is used to wait for a promise to be resolved before continuing execution. Here's an example:
    ```typescript
    async function fetchData() {
        try {
            const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
            const data = await response.json();
            return data;
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
            throw error;
        }
    }

    // Calling the async function
    fetchData()
        .then(data => console.log('Data:', data))
        .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
    ```

### Type Assertion and Type Guards:

52. **What is type assertion in TypeScript?**
    - Type assertion in TypeScript is a way to tell the compiler about the type of a variable when the compiler cannot infer the type automatically. It allows you to override the default behavior of the type checker and assert that a value is of a specific type.

53. **Explain the difference between `<Type>` and `as Type` syntax for type assertion.**
    - Both `<Type>` and `as Type` syntaxes are used for type assertion in TypeScript, but they have subtle differences:
      - `<Type>` syntax is the angle-bracket syntax and is used primarily in TypeScript's JSX syntax. It is not recommended for use in TypeScript code unless you are working with JSX.
      - `as Type` syntax is the preferred way to perform type assertion in TypeScript. It is more readable and is compatible with both JSX and non-JSX code.

54. **What are type guards in TypeScript?**
    - Type guards in TypeScript are techniques used to narrow down the type of a variable within a certain block of code. They are used to perform runtime checks to determine whether a value is of a specific type. Type guards help TypeScript infer more specific types and provide type safety in complex code bases.

55. **Provide examples of using type guards with `typeof` and `instanceof`.**
    - **Using `typeof`:** Type guards with `typeof` are used to narrow down types based on the types of values. For example:
      ```typescript
      function logValue(value: string | number): void {
          if (typeof value === 'string') {
              console.log('Value is a string:', value.toUpperCase());
          } else {
              console.log('Value is a number:', value.toFixed(2));
          }
      }
      ```
    - **Using `instanceof`:** Type guards with `instanceof` are used to narrow down types based on the constructor functions of objects. For example:
      ```typescript
      class Animal {
          name: string;
          constructor(name: string) {
              this.name = name;
          }
      }
      
      class Dog extends Animal {
          breed: string;
          constructor(name: string, breed: string) {
              super(name);
              this.breed = breed;
          }
      }
      
      function speak(animal: Animal): void {
          if (animal instanceof Dog) {
              console.log(`The ${animal.breed} dog named ${animal.name} says woof!`);
          } else {
              console.log(`The animal named ${animal.name} makes some noise!`);
          }
      }
      ```

### Type Compatibility:

56. **What is type compatibility in TypeScript?**
    - Type compatibility in TypeScript refers to the ability to assign values of one type to variables of another type. TypeScript uses a structural type system, which means that types are based on the shape or structure of the value rather than explicit declarations. Type compatibility allows for more flexible and intuitive type checking.

57. **Explain how type compatibility works with interfaces.**
    - Type compatibility with interfaces in TypeScript is based on structural typing. If an object has all the required properties and their types match the properties specified in an interface, then that object is considered compatible with the interface, even if it has additional properties. Here's an example:
    ```typescript
    interface Point {
        x: number;
        y: number;
    }

    let point: Point = { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 }; // Additional property 'z' is allowed
    ```

58. **How do you handle type compatibility with functions?**
    - Type compatibility with functions in TypeScript is determined by comparing the parameter types and return type of the functions. TypeScript uses parameter variance for function parameter types, meaning that a function parameter type can be a subtype of the corresponding parameter type in another function. Additionally, TypeScript checks that the return type of a function is assignable to the return type expected by the caller.

59. **What is structural typing in TypeScript? Explain with an example.**
    - Structural typing in TypeScript means that types are based on the shape or structure of the value rather than explicit declarations. If two types have the same structure, they are considered compatible, even if they are declared separately. Here's an example:
    ```typescript
    interface Person {
        name: string;
        age: number;
    }

    interface Employee {
        name: string;
        age: number;
        jobTitle: string;
    }

    function printPerson(person: Person): void {
        console.log(`Name: ${person.name}, Age: ${person.age}`);
    }

    let employee: Employee = {
        name: "Alice",
        age: 30,
        jobTitle: "Software Engineer"
    };

    printPerson(employee); // Employee is structurally compatible with Person
    ```

In the example above, even though `Employee` is not explicitly declared as implementing `Person`, it is still compatible with `Person` because it has all the required properties with matching types. This is an example of structural typing in action.

### Advanced Types:

60. **What are mapped types in TypeScript?**
    - Mapped types in TypeScript allow you to transform the properties of an existing type into a new type. You can use mapped types to create new types based on existing ones by applying a transformation to each property in the original type. Mapped types are defined using the `keyof` operator and indexed access types. They are particularly useful for creating new types with optional, readonly, or modified properties.

61. **Explain the utility types provided by TypeScript (e.g., Partial, Readonly, Pick).**
    - TypeScript provides several utility types that simplify common type transformations and manipulations:
      - **Partial\<T\>:** Constructs a type with all properties of type T set to optional.
      - **Readonly\<T\>:** Constructs a type with all properties of type T set to readonly.
      - **Pick\<T, K\>:** Constructs a type by picking the set of properties specified by the keys of type K from type T.
      - **Record\<K, T\>:** Constructs an object type whose property keys are from type K and values are of type T.
      - **Exclude\<T, U\>:** Constructs a type by excluding all properties of type U from type T.
      - **Omit\<T, K\>:** Constructs a type by omitting the set of properties specified by the keys of type K from type T.
      - **ReturnType\<T\>:** Extracts the return type of a function type.
      - **Parameters\<T\>:** Extracts the parameter types of a function type.

62. **How do you use conditional types in TypeScript?**
    - Conditional types in TypeScript allow you to create types that depend on other types. They enable you to perform type transformations based on conditions. Conditional types are defined using the `extends` keyword and the ternary conditional operator `? :`. They are particularly useful for creating generic types that adapt based on the types they are applied to.

63. **What is the keyof operator used for in TypeScript?**
    - The `keyof` operator in TypeScript is a type operator that produces a union type of all property names of a given type. It allows you to create types that represent the keys of an object without specifying them explicitly. The syntax is `keyof Type`.

64. **How do you create a type-safe builder pattern in TypeScript?**
    - A type-safe builder pattern in TypeScript involves creating a series of builder functions that progressively build up an object, enforcing type safety at each step. Each builder function adds properties to the object and returns a new object with the additional properties. Here's an example:
    ```typescript
    interface Person {
        name: string;
        age: number;
        email: string;
    }

    class PersonBuilder {
        private person: Partial<Person> = {};

        setName(name: string): this {
            this.person.name = name;
            return this;
        }

        setAge(age: number): this {
            this.person.age = age;
            return this;
        }

        setEmail(email: string): this {
            this.person.email = email;
            return this;
        }

        build(): Person {
            if (!this.person.name || !this.person.age || !this.person.email) {
                throw new Error("Name, age, and email are required");
            }
            return this.person as Person;
        }
    }

    // Usage
    const person = new PersonBuilder()
        .setName("Alice")
        .setAge(30)
        .setEmail("alice@example.com")
        .build();
    ```

### Tooling and Integration:

65. **How do you configure TypeScript in a project?**
    - TypeScript can be configured in a project using a `tsconfig.json` file, which contains compiler options and settings for the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). You can customize various compiler options such as target ECMAScript version, module system, output directory, and more.

66. **What is tsconfig.json and what does it contain?**
    - `tsconfig.json` is a configuration file used to specify compiler options and settings for the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). It allows you to define how TypeScript files are compiled in your project. The `tsconfig.json` file contains JSON data with various compiler options such as `compilerOptions`, `include`, `exclude`, `extends`, and more.

67. **How do you integrate TypeScript with popular build tools like Webpack or Parcel?**
    - **Webpack:** To integrate TypeScript with Webpack, you need to install `typescript` and `ts-loader` packages. Then, you can configure Webpack to use `ts-loader` for TypeScript files in your `webpack.config.js`. Here's a basic configuration:
      ```javascript
      module.exports = {
          // Other webpack config options...
          module: {
              rules: [
                  {
                      test: /\.tsx?$/,
                      use: 'ts-loader',
                      exclude: /node_modules/,
                  },
              ],
          },
          resolve: {
              extensions: ['.tsx', '.ts', '.js'],
          },
      };
      ```
    - **Parcel:** Parcel automatically detects and compiles TypeScript files out of the box. You don't need to configure anything special to use TypeScript with Parcel. Just make sure your entry file has a `.ts` or `.tsx` extension, and Parcel will handle the rest.

68. **Explain the role of TSLint and its alternatives in TypeScript projects.**
    - TSLint is a static analysis tool for TypeScript that checks your TypeScript code for readability, maintainability, and functionality errors. It helps enforce coding standards and best practices in TypeScript projects. However, TSLint has been deprecated in favor of ESLint, which supports TypeScript out of the box via plugins. ESLint has become the standard linter for TypeScript projects, offering more features, better performance, and a larger community ecosystem. Alternatives to TSLint include ESLint with TypeScript support, which provides similar linting functionality along with TypeScript-specific rules.

### Testing in TypeScript:

69. **How do you write unit tests for TypeScript code?**
    - Unit tests for TypeScript code are typically written using testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, or Ava. You write test cases that verify the behavior of individual functions or modules in your TypeScript code. Unit tests often involve setting up test data, calling the function or module under test, and asserting the expected outcomes.

70. **What are the popular testing frameworks for TypeScript?**
    - Some popular testing frameworks for TypeScript include:
      - **Jest:** A complete testing framework with built-in support for mocking, assertions, and code coverage.
      - **Mocha:** A flexible testing framework that provides a simple and extensible API for writing tests.
      - **Jasmine:** A behavior-driven development (BDD) framework that focuses on readability and expressive syntax.
      - **Ava:** A minimalist testing framework that runs tests concurrently for faster feedback.

71. **Explain the use of mocking libraries in TypeScript tests.**
    - Mocking libraries in TypeScript tests are used to replace dependencies with fake objects (mocks) in order to isolate the code under test. Mocks simulate the behavior of real dependencies, allowing you to control their responses and interactions during testing. This helps you test the behavior of your code in isolation without relying on external dependencies. Popular mocking libraries for TypeScript include Jest's built-in mocking capabilities, Sinon.js, and ts-mockito.

72. **How do you test asynchronous code in TypeScript?**
    - Asynchronous code in TypeScript can be tested using asynchronous testing techniques provided by testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, or Ava. These frameworks support asynchronous test cases using callback functions, promises, or async/await syntax. You can use techniques such as `done` callbacks, returning promises, or using async/await to ensure that asynchronous code behaves as expected. Additionally, you can use Jest's `async` and `await` APIs or Mocha's `async` function to simplify testing asynchronous code.

### TypeScript in Real-world Applications:

73. **What are the common use cases for TypeScript?**
    - TypeScript is commonly used in various scenarios, including:
      - Web development: Building frontend applications using frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue.js.
      - Node.js development: Writing server-side applications and APIs using TypeScript with Express.js or NestJS.
      - Desktop and mobile app development: Using TypeScript with frameworks like Electron or React Native.
      - Testing: Writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for TypeScript codebases.
      - Tooling and automation: Building CLI tools, task runners, and build scripts using TypeScript.

74. **How does TypeScript improve large-scale application development?**

Additionally, TypeScript's tooling support, including IDE integrations and type-checking capabilities, significantly enhanced the development experience, allowing teams to write cleaner, more maintainable code with confidence.

76. **What are the challenges you've faced when using TypeScript in projects?**
    - While TypeScript offers many benefits, it also comes with its own set of challenges:
      - Learning curve: TypeScript introduces additional concepts and syntax compared to plain JavaScript, which can require some learning and adaptation for developers new to the language.
      - Integration with third-party libraries: Some third-party libraries may not have TypeScript definitions available, requiring developers to write their own type definitions or use the `any` type for interop.
      - Build tool configuration: Configuring TypeScript with build tools like Webpack or Parcel can sometimes be complex, especially for more advanced use cases or when integrating with other tools and technologies.
      - Performance overhead: TypeScript's static type checking and compilation process can add overhead to the build process, potentially impacting development and build times, especially in larger projects. However, the benefits usually outweigh the performance cost.

### TypeScript Best Practices:

77. **What are some best practices for writing TypeScript code?**
    - Use explicit types: Always annotate variables, parameters, return types, and function signatures with explicit types to improve code readability and maintainability.
    - Enable strict mode: Enable TypeScript's strict mode (`strict` compiler option) to enforce stricter type checking and catch more potential errors at compile time.
    - Use interfaces and types: Define clear and descriptive interfaces and types to represent data shapes and contracts in your code.
    - Prefer const and readonly: Use `const` for immutable values and `readonly` for immutable properties to prevent unintended mutations.
    - Avoid any type: Minimize the use of the `any` type, as it undermines TypeScript's type safety features. Instead, use more specific types or properly type third-party libraries.
    - Enable strict null checks: Enable TypeScript's strict null checks (`strictNullChecks` compiler option) to catch null and undefined errors more effectively.
    - Use type inference: Leverage TypeScript's type inference capabilities to reduce the need for explicit type annotations where possible, while still maintaining type safety.
    - Follow naming conventions: Use consistent and descriptive naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, and interfaces to improve code clarity and maintainability.
    - Write tests: Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to validate the behavior and type correctness of your TypeScript code.
    - Keep code modular: Encapsulate functionality into small, reusable modules with clear interfaces and dependencies to improve code maintainability and reusability.

78. **How do you handle typing for third-party libraries in TypeScript?**
    - Typing for third-party libraries in TypeScript can be handled in several ways:
      - Use official type definitions: Many popular libraries provide official type definitions through the DefinitelyTyped repository (`@types/`). You can install these type definitions using npm or yarn.
      - Create custom type definitions: If a library does not have official type definitions, you can create custom type definitions in a separate `.d.ts` file and include them in your project.
      - Use type assertion: If you're working with JavaScript libraries that lack type definitions, you can use type assertion (`as`) to assert the type of variables or objects.

79. **Explain the benefits of using strict mode in TypeScript.**
    - Strict mode in TypeScript (`strict` compiler option) enables a set of strict type-checking options that enforce better type safety and catch more potential errors at compile time. Some benefits of using strict mode include:
      - Prevention of silent errors: Strict mode helps catch common programming mistakes and prevent unintended behavior by enforcing stricter type checking rules.
      - Improved code quality: By catching errors early in the development process, strict mode helps improve code quality, reliability, and maintainability.
      - Enhanced refactoring: With stricter type checking, refactoring code becomes safer and easier, as TypeScript can provide more accurate type information and detect potential issues during the refactoring process.

80. **How do you ensure type safety in a TypeScript project?**
    - To ensure type safety in a TypeScript project, you can follow these practices:
      - Enable strict mode: Enable TypeScript's strict mode (`strict` compiler option) to enforce stricter type checking rules and catch more potential errors at compile time.
      - Use explicit types: Annotate variables, parameters, return types, and function signatures with explicit types to ensure type correctness and prevent type-related errors.
      - Enable strict null checks: Enable TypeScript's strict null checks (`strictNullChecks` compiler option) to prevent null and undefined errors by explicitly handling nullable types.
      - Leverage TypeScript's type system: Take advantage of TypeScript's type inference, union types, intersection types, generics, and other advanced type features to ensure type safety and express complex data relationships accurately.
      - Write tests: Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to validate the behavior and type correctness of your TypeScript code, ensuring that it behaves as expected under different scenarios and edge cases.

### Performance Optimization:


81. **What are some strategies for optimizing TypeScript code for performance?**
    - Some strategies for optimizing TypeScript code for performance include:
      - Minimize unnecessary type conversions: Avoid unnecessary type conversions, especially in performance-critical code paths, as they can incur runtime overhead.
      - Use efficient data structures and algorithms: Choose the most appropriate data structures and algorithms for your use case to optimize performance.
      - Limit object allocations: Minimize unnecessary object allocations by reusing objects where possible or using object pooling techniques.
      - Optimize loops and iterations: Optimize loops and iterations by reducing unnecessary iterations, avoiding excessive object creation, and optimizing loop conditions.
      - Use compile-time optimizations: Leverage TypeScript's type system and compile-time optimizations to reduce runtime overhead and improve performance.
      - Profile and optimize hotspots: Identify performance bottlenecks using profiling tools and optimize hotspots by refactoring or optimizing critical sections of code.

82. **Explain the impact of type assertions on performance.**
    - Type assertions in TypeScript have minimal to no impact on runtime performance because they are purely compile-time constructs. Type assertions are used to tell the TypeScript compiler about the type of a variable or expression, but they do not introduce any runtime checks or conversions. Therefore, type assertions do not incur any runtime overhead and have no impact on the performance of the compiled JavaScript code.

83. **How do you optimize TypeScript code for memory usage?**
    - Some strategies for optimizing TypeScript code for memory usage include:
      - Minimize object allocations: Reduce unnecessary object allocations by reusing objects where possible, using object pooling techniques, or allocating memory in bulk.
      - Avoid memory leaks: Be mindful of memory leaks caused by circular references, event listeners, or long-lived references to objects, and ensure that objects are properly garbage-collected when no longer needed.
      - Optimize data structures: Choose the most memory-efficient data structures for your use case, considering factors such as size, memory layout, and access patterns.
      - Use memory profiling tools: Use memory profiling tools to identify memory usage patterns, detect memory leaks, and optimize memory-intensive code paths.
      - Limit unnecessary data duplication: Minimize unnecessary data duplication and copying by using immutable data structures, lazy loading techniques, or shared memory buffers.

84. **Discuss the trade-offs between type safety and performance in TypeScript.**
    - There is often a trade-off between type safety and performance in TypeScript, as stricter type checking and enforcement of type safety can sometimes incur runtime overhead. While TypeScript's type system provides many benefits in terms of code clarity, maintainability, and bug prevention, it may introduce some performance overhead due to additional runtime checks and type assertions. However, the impact of type safety on performance is typically minimal compared to the benefits it provides in terms of code correctness and reliability. In general, it's important to strike a balance between type safety and performance based on the specific requirements and constraints of your project, optimizing for clarity, maintainability, and performance as needed.

    - To ensure secure coding practices when using TypeScript, you can:
      - Follow security best practices: Stay informed about common security vulnerabilities and best practices for secure coding, and apply them to your TypeScript codebase.
      - Conduct security reviews: Perform regular code reviews and security assessments to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities in your TypeScript code.
      - Use security tools: Use static analysis tools, vulnerability scanners, and security testing frameworks to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in your TypeScript applications.
      - Implement security controls: Implement security controls such as input validation, output encoding, authentication, access control, and encryption to protect against common security threats.
      - Stay up-to-date: Keep your dependencies, frameworks, and development tools up-to-date to ensure you have the latest security patches and updates.

92. **Share examples of security-related features provided by TypeScript.**
    - TypeScript provides several features that contribute to the security of web applications, including:
      - **Static typing:** TypeScript's static type system helps catch type-related errors and vulnerabilities early in the development process, reducing the risk of runtime errors and security vulnerabilities.
      - **Strict null checks:** TypeScript's strict null checks help prevent null and undefined errors by enforcing stricter null checking rules, reducing the risk of potential security vulnerabilities such as null pointer dereferences or unexpected behavior due to undefined values.
      - **Type inference:** TypeScript's type inference capabilities help automatically infer types based on context, reducing the need for explicit type annotations and improving code readability and maintainability.
      - **Type annotations:** TypeScript allows developers to annotate variables, parameters, return types, and function signatures with explicit types, helping enforce type safety and prevent common security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, XSS, and data leaks.
